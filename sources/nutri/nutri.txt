Your comments are refining the PLM syntax quite effectively. Here are some structured takeaways and suggested refinements based on your observations:

1. :do Directive
	â€¢	Purpose: It extends :plan by moving beyond LLM calls to actual execution.
	â€¢	Refinement: Since :do should not contain executable code but rather structured branching or pseudocode, it should be explicitly documented that itâ€™s meant for workflow control, not direct execution.
	â€¢	Syntax Improvement: Instead of looking like Python, :do should be more declarative, resembling a DSL-like branching system.
	â€¢	Example:

:do
  when guardrail_check.accept == false -> raise BlockedInputError(guardrail_check.reply)
  when route_decision.route == "image_analysis" -> ask image_analysis
  when route_decision.route == "customer_support" -> ask customer_support
  otherwise -> ask nutrition_expert
:--


	â€¢	This would avoid confusion with actual Python execution.

2. :ask Input Types
	â€¢	Your point on supporting non-text inputs (e.g., base64_image_data) is important.
	â€¢	Refinement: Instead of embedding images as strings inside the prompt (which is inefficient), :ask should support structured input parameters like:

:ask image_analysis
input:
  image: base64_image_data
  user_message: "{user_message}"
:return_type "ImageAnalysisResult"


	â€¢	This keeps inputs structured while ensuring the model can interpret them correctly.

3. :reflect as Background Process
	â€¢	Key Idea: Reflection isnâ€™t just a directive; itâ€™s a parallel quality control mechanism.
	â€¢	Possible Refinement: Instead of treating :reflect like a static directive at the end, it should be attached to scopes.
	â€¢	Example:

:reflect throughout module
  "Ensure all decisions conform to compliance rules and verify that cached results are correct."
:--


	â€¢	This would mean reflection occurs dynamically during execution, not just as a final step.

4. Identifier Usage (:ask name)
	â€¢	You like the fact that named identifiers (e.g., route_decision) allow referencing between blocks.
	â€¢	Should It Be Required?
	â€¢	Having identifiers as optional but encouraged makes sense.
	â€¢	If an identifier is present, it should be navigable (i.e., used as a reference in :do blocks).
	â€¢	Alternative:

:ask [route_decision]

	â€¢	The square brackets could indicate itâ€™s a referencable step, while unnamed :ask blocks are one-off.

5. Removing Redundant :verify
	â€¢	Since return types are structured data, verification should be implicit when a return type is present.
	â€¢	New Rule:
	â€¢	If :return_type is defined, :verify is optional unless additional constraints are needed.

Next Steps?

Would you like to test a refactored version of this syntax based on these refinements? I can generate a cleaned-up draft with:
âœ… Structured :do syntax
âœ… Support for structured inputs in :ask
âœ… Scoping for :reflect
âœ… Implicit :verify
âœ… Optional but encouraged identifiers

Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed! ðŸš€
