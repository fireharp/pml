    Find the most relevant knowledge base articles for this customer query:
    "{customer_query}"

    Customer context:

## Response Generation

Generate personalized, contextually appropriate responses:

```python
customer_history = {
    "name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "previous_issues": ["billing discrepancy", "feature request"],
    "sentiment": "frustrated",
    "lifetime_value": "high",
    "current_issue": "Unable to export reports from analytics dashboard"
}

:do generate_response
Create a personalized response for this customer who is having trouble exporting reports.
Be empathetic, address their frustration, and provide a clear solution.
Use the customer history information to personalize the response.

Hi Sarah,

I'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble exporting reports from the analytics dashboard. I understand how frustrating this must be, especially since you rely on these reports for your work. As a valued customer, your experience matters greatly to us, and I want to get this resolved for you right away.

I've looked into the issue, and there are a couple of potential solutions we can try:

1. **Clear your browser cache**: Sometimes cached data can interfere with the export functionality. Here's how:
   - In Chrome: Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Clear browsing data
   - In Firefox: Go to Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data > Clear Data

2. **Try an alternative export method**:
   - Instead of using the "Export" button in the dashboard header, try right-clicking on the report and selecting "Export as" from the context menu
   - Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E (or Cmd+Shift+E on Mac)

3. **Check your permissions**: I've verified that your account should have full export capabilities, but if you're accessing this through a team workspace, there might be a permission setting that needs adjustment.

If none of these solutions work, I'd be happy to schedule a quick screen-sharing session to troubleshoot this together in real-time. As one of our high-value customers, we want to ensure you have uninterrupted access to all the analytics features you need.

Could you let me know if any of these solutions work for you? I'll keep this ticket open and prioritized until we get this resolved.

Best regards,
[Your Support Representative]

    2. Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
    3. Estimated resolution time

    Support ticket:
